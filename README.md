# Quizzler ðŸ¤“
Quzzler is a simple quizz game where you have to choose true or false. During this project I learned and applied **MVC** pattern. The UI developed with Storyboard. Users can track their progress by viewing the bar located at the bottom of the app as they find the correct answers. Additionally, a score label on the left top of the app increases in accordance with the user's progress.

### Note

During this app I followed Dr. Angela Yu's udemy course.
